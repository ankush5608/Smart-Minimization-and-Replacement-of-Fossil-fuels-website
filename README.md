# Smart-Minimization-and-Replacement-of-Fossil-fuels website

This is a website being built for informative purpose and bringing awareness and some possible futuristic solutions inorder to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and find some alternative reference for it as well.
Given below is the link of the website hosted

The solution which is been shown in this website is as follows:
1. The simple and easy replacement of fossil fuels are by using renewable sources like hydrogen fuel and electric vehicles instead of the fossil fuels powered vehicles.
2. The issue is  electric vehicles(EVs) and hydrogen fueled vehicles are not present in bulk. We have fossil fuel powered vehicles in abundant quantity and still new vehicles are been manufactured and if this is the case it will easily take around 25 to 30 years on replacement of fossil fuels
