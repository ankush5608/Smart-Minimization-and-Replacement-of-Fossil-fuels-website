# Smart-Minimization-and-Replacement-of-Fossil-fuels website

This is a website being built for informative purpose and bringing awareness and some possible futuristic solutions inorder to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and find some alternative reference for it as well.

The solution which is been shown in this website is as follows:

1.The simple and easy replacement of fossil fuels are by using renewable sources like hydrogen fuel and electric vehicles instead of the fossil fuels powered vehicles.

2.The issue is electric vehicles(EVs) and hydrogen fueled vehicles are not present in bulk. We have fossil fuel powered vehicles in abundant quantity and still new vehicles are been manufactured and if this is the case it will easily take around 25 to 30 years on replacement of fossil fuel powered vehicles and hence there must be some solution to save fuel in such circumstance. And thus the solution proposed will be like, we have seen much of vehicles being in on condition even in traffic and certain events where unecessary consumption of fossil fuel take place and this could be stopped by connecting the computer vision technology with fuel tank where in when ever there is red light o spotted that many vehicles are at rest then the vehicle will be switched off and accordingly when light goes green or vehicles start moving the vehicles are started on. This saves a small quantity of fuel for an individual vehicle but when it comes to millions of vehicles running on road then the amount of fuel saved is large.

3.We have found that wind mills or solar pannels produce consistent amount of energy but when there is a sudden increase in temperature or increase in wind speed these wind mills and solar pannels produce more energy than required and this excess energy produced gets wasted and hence we can save this energy by storing the excess energy in grid with the help of AI.

These are the solutions proposed which aims at minimizing and replacement of fossil fuels.
